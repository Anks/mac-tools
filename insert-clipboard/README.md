# insert-clipboard

AppleScript script to type whatever is on your clipboard.

This is useful on websites where pasting text is blocked (eg: logging in to a website where the password field doesn't allow you to paste the password).

I typically run this via Alfred or using a keyboard shortcut.

Note: you will need to grant accessibility permission in System Settings when first running this script.
